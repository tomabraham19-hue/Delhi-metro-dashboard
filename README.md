# Delhi-metro-dashboard
ðŸ“– Introduction
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the Delhi Metro Network using Power BI. The dataset contains information about metro lines, opening dates, station names, and other details related to the Delhi Metro system.
The goal is to clean the data, visualize network expansion, and extract key insights regarding operational years, connectivity, and growth trends.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
Before visualization, the dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy:

Removed null or duplicate values.
Standardized text formatting (line names, station names).
Fixed inconsistent date formats.
Created calculated columns for analysis such as Years Since Opening.
Replaced missing values with defaults like "None" for clarity.
ðŸ§° Tools Used
Microsoft Power BI â€“ Data visualization and modeling.
Microsoft Excel / Power Query â€“ Data cleaning and transformation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ For creating calculated measures and KPIs.
CSV Dataset â€“ Base data source (Delhi-Metro-Network.csv).
ðŸ“Š Visualizations & Insights
Key insights derived from the dashboard:

Trend of metro expansion over the years.
Operational years for each line.
Connectivity distribution across different lines.
Identification of oldest and newest lines.
Interactive visuals using dark theme with red highlights.
ðŸ”® Future Outcomes
Integration with real-time Delhi Metro updates via APIs.
Predictive analysis for passenger growth and route optimization.
Comparative analysis with other metro systems in India.
Enhancement of dashboard interactivity using bookmarks and drill-through features.
âœ… Conclusion
The Delhi Metro Network Power BI Dashboard provides a clear visualization of how the metro has grown and evolved over time.
Through proper data cleaning, modeling, and visual analysis, it highlights the efficiency and scale of one of Indiaâ€™s largest urban transit systems.
